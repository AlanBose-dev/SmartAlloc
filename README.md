# Budget Planner Web App (SmartAlloc)

A frontend-focused personal finance planner built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

This project allows users to track income and expenses, define budget limits and savings goals, and view spending insights through interactive dashboards and reports.

The application is implemented without a backend. All data is stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`. The main focus of this project is frontend logic, UI design, and state management.
